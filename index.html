    <article>This is the case for Ferrari and its first victory which came in 1947 courtesy of the 125 S. That win would
        be the first milestone in the genuinely unparalleled sporting career of a team that has clocked up more Formula
        1 victories than any other. That first win had its roots in mid-1945 when Enzo Ferrari commissioned Gioachino
        Colombo to design a completely innovative car for him. Ferrari’s ambition was, of course, to beat the Alfa
        Romeos which he knew intimately as he had spent so much time with the Milan team, first as a driver, then as
        sporting director, racking up triumph after triumph in the pre-War years. As far as Enzo Ferrari was concerned
        the engine was the heart of any car. Hence his incredible focus on the power unit from that first design
        onwards. The choice fell on a 12-cylinder architecture, which would have the power to deliver the kind of
        performance required. The engine moniker, 125, referenced its unit displacement: 125 multiplied by 12 gives the
        overall displacement of the engine, a mere 1,500cc.</article>
